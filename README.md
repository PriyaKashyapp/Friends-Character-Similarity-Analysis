# Friends-Character-Similarity-Analysis
This project explores the application of vector space models in natural language processing to quantify the similarity between characters from the popular TV show "Friends". By analyzing dialogue scripts, the project employs semantic analysis techniques to understand character interactions and similarities.
Key Features

    Semantic Analysis: Utilizes techniques like TF-IDF and cosine similarity to analyze character dialogues.
    Character Profiling: Builds semantic profiles for each main character to explore underlying patterns and relationships.
    Visualization: Includes visual representations of character similarities and clustering.
Technologies Used

    Python: Primary programming language
    Libraries: NLTK, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn
    
Results and Discussion

This analysis reveals distinct semantic landscapes for each character, reflecting their unique traits and relationships within the show. The results section in the Jupyter notebook discusses the implications of these findings for understanding character dynamics and narrative development.
